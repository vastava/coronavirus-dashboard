## [Modeling the Coronavirus: Estimating the date of exposure to the virus given the date of diagnosis
](https://vastava.github.io/coronavirus-dashboard/)

This project involved modeling the number of Coronavirus cases by date of exposure to the virus given the date of confirmed diagnosis. The website explains the methdology in greater detail, and hosts an interactive dashboard built in d3.
The relevant code is in the [jupyter notebooks folder](https://github.com/vastava/coronavirus-dashboard/tree/master/jupyter%20notebooks) â€” there is a scraper for the data from worldometers, and a notebook for the model itself.
This project is the first part in a broader analysis I am doing of the coronavirus response in countries around the world.
